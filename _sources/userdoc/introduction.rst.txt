The *be_founders-employees* database
====================================

.. _introdata-label:

Data
----

The database has rich microdata about a large number (99k+) of people who
worked for a set of Belgian start-ups (see :numref:`introsample-label` for
information on the start-ups). The database includes nearly all the employees that
worked for these start-ups, as well as the founders.

The data source is a **w**\ell-known **e**\mployment-**f**\ocused social
media **p**\latform (henceforth WEFP), where all the data is publicly-available.
WEFP has two types of users: real persons and corporate persons.

WEFP users who are real persons create a personal page where they share personal
details, educational background and employment history.
WEFP users who are corporate persons create a business page for their company,
school, NGO, etc.
Users of both types share posts, pictures, videos, and documents; and engage
with other WEFP users in public, as well as private, interactions.

We relied on mechanized search tools (a.k.a. scrapers or web bots) to retrieve
information from users' profiles. Additionally, we used machine learning tools
to parse the data and derive indicators at the person- and start-up-level. At the
employee-level, the database contains information on three main areas:

#. Individual characteristics:
    * Name
    * Gender
    * Age (etc.)
#. Education history:
    * Educational institution
    * Study program
    * Start/end date
    * Location
#. Work experience:
    * Employer
    * Job title
    * Start/end date of the position
    * Location

At the start-up-level, the database contains rich information about personnel
dynamics (e.g., employee entry and exit, internal promotions, etc.).

.. admonition:: Antecedent: The *be_founders* database

  The *be_founders* database contains rich microdata about the founders of a
  large set of Belgian start-ups. This includes the founders' education and work
  experience, but also networks and co-founding links. The database includes
  start-ups' financial information as well.

  Refer to the `documentation <https://manuelgig.github.io/be_founders_documentation/>`_
  of the *be_founders* project for more information.

.. _introsample-label:

Sample
------

We built the sample in several steps:

#. We retrieved a list of all Belgian start-ups listed in Crunchbase.
#. We ran a mechanized search process to look up the start-ups in WEFP and
   obtain their WEFP unique identifier (*uuid*).
#. We ran mechanized searches in WEFP to identify users who worked in at least
   one of the start-ups (either who worked in the past, or were working at the
   time of data collection, between April and December 2022).
#. We retrieved data about the users found in step three, which is publicly
   available in WEFP; this includes, but is not limited to, work- and
   education-background data.
#. We carefully parsed, cleaned, disambiguated, and structured
   the data obtained in step four, in order to build the employees' complete career
   and educational trajectories. This way we identified thousands of *events* in
   the life of the employees.
#. We used event data to build data at the start-up level.

The resulting database includes the work and study careers of 99,432 employees,
who worked for 910 Belgian start-ups. It comprises 997k events, divided into
246k study events and 751k job market events.

.. _event_def-label:

.. admonition:: Events

  We define an *event* as a spell, or period, in the life of an employee during
  which she works or studies. There are two types of events:

  * Work event (includes start/end time, employer, location, role, area/field,
    hierarchy, etc.)

  * Study event (includes start/end time, education institution, degree type,
    area/field, etc.)

  We use events within and between employees and start-ups to create indicators
  about career advance, skills, networks, job creation, etc.

  The total (i.e., added) duration of the work event spells is 1,738,000
  years (or about 18 years per person, on average). The total duration of the
  study events is 587k years (or about 6 years per person, on average).

.. admonition:: Start-up work vs non-start-up work

  Start-up employment represents only 17% (133k) of the job market events
  (or about 20% of the recorded employment time) in the database. This suggests
  that working for start-ups is but a phase in the lives of the typical
  individual in the database, and there is great potential from using data
  phase. This is what we set out to do by collecting career and education
  background data.

Database structure and contents
-------------------------------

We developed the database using Python and PostgreSQL, and release it as a db
dump in a single .tar file. The database that we release has four schemas:

* **raw:** contains tables with raw (i.e., unprocessed) data that we extracted
  from the html files obtained by the web scrapers (e.g., raw company names,
  or job titles)
* **log:** contains logs of the search and download steps (e.g., URL's, time,
  etc.)
* **main:** contains tables with parsed event data (e.g., events, job titles,
  education programs, locations, etc.)
* **public:** contains tables with information we generated with data from the
  **main** schema (e.g., start-up employee turnover) as well as data from
  other sources (e.g., O*NET job titles, Orbis' company financials)

Each schema contains tables, and tables are linked to each other by a system
of foreign keys. A description of the tables and their contents is given in
:numref:`tables-label`.
