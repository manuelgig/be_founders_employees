Sample and primary data sources
###############################

We built the sample in several steps:

#. We retrieved a list of all Belgian start-ups listed in CrunchBase.
#. We ran a mechanized search process to look up the start-ups in WEFP and
   obtain their WEFP unique identifier (*uuid*).
#. We ran mechanized searches in WEFP to identify users who worked in at least
   one of the start-ups (either who worked in the past, or were working at the
   time of data collection, between April and December 2022).
#. We retrieved data about the users found in step three, which is publicly
   available in WEFP; this includes, but is not limited to, work- and
   education-background data.
#. We carefully parsed, cleaned, disambiguated, and structured
   the data obtained in step four, in order to build the employees' complete career
   and educational trajectories. This way we identified thousands of *events* in
   the life of the employees.
#. We used event data to build data at the start-up level.

The resulting database includes the work and study careers of 99,432 employees,
who worked for 910 Belgian start-ups. It comprises 997k events, divided into
246k study events and 751k job market events.
