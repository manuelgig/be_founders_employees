Quick start
===========

*Please go quickly over* :numref:`introdata-label` *(Data) and*
:numref:`introsample-label` *(Sample) before you proceed with this section.*

Event table
-----------

Table :ref:`tables-event-label` is the main table in the database, and it
contains the events in the lives of employees. An event is a spell, or period,
in the life of an employee during which she works or studies (see
:numref:`introsample-label` for more details on how we define an event).

.. admonition:: Important

  A work experience event relates a person to an employer (or to no employer, if
  the event is a freelancer/independent one). The event table records **all**
  work experience events, and not only those work events related to Belgian start-ups
  in our database.

A row of :ref:`tables-event-label` represents an event:

* *uuid:* the event's unique identifier (i.e., no two rows share the same *uuid*)
* *uuid_person_organization_link:* a unique identifier for a
  person-organization relationship. When person A works for company B we say
  there is a person-organization relationship between A and B. Similarly, when
  person A studies at school C, we say there is a person-organization
  relationship between A and C. Table :ref:`tables-person_organization_link-label`
  records the unique person-organization links
* *date_start / date_end:* indicate when the spell started and finished.
  Some events are missing both values (if the starting and finishing date
  was not reported in WEFP).
* *is_exp:* equals 1 when the event is a work experience event, and 0 when it is
  an education experience one
* *curr_role:* equals 1 when the experience event was the **current** job role
  at the time of data collection (i.e., the focal person was working on this
  job). When *curr_role*==1, *date_end* has a missing value
* *uuid_location:* unique identifier for the event location (foreign key to
  table :ref:`tables-location-label`)
* *uuid_role_parsed / uuid_program_parsed:* unique identifier for the focal
  event's role or program title. They are foreign keys to tables
  :ref:`tables-role-label` and :ref:`tables-program-label`
* *person_job_seq*: indicates the relative position of the focal work event in the
  focal person's career path (e.g., *person_job_seq*\==1 is the person's first
  job)
* *org_hire_seq*: when the focal work experience event involves one of our
  Belgian start-ups, this value indicates the relative position of this event
  in the firm's hiring/promotion history. E.g., when *org_hire_seq*\==10 the
  focal event represents the 10th role started at the Belgian startup by any
  employee (if the firm only hired new employees, this would also be the 10th
  hire)
* *person_edu_seq*: indicates the relative position of the focal study event in
  the focal person's study path  (e.g., *person_edu_seq*\==1 is the person's first
  study event)

Flat tables
-----------

Given the database structure, a typical analysis will involve combining and
merging multiple tables. To reduce such initial building costs, and to
facilitate initial data manipulation and exploration, we include a set of
ready-to-use tables that already combine the essential fields and indicators.

Table :ref:`tables-event_flat-label` is an expanded version of table
:ref:`tables-event-label`. Each row represents an event, but here the data
is enriched with location, role, program, individual, and organization data.
As well, we include many variables that we calculated using event and related
tables. See :ref:`tables-event_flat-label` to find out about these variables
and their definitions.
