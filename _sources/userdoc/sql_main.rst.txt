Using the db
============

In order to use the database you need to have a PostgreSQL database running somewhere
in your computer (if you do it locally) or in the cloud (e.g., in AWS, GC, etc.).

#. If you don't have PostgreSQL running in your computer you need to install it
   First

   #. Install PostgreSQL (download it `here <https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads>`_)
   #. Open your database manager (e.g., `DBeaver <https://dbeaver.io/>`_)
      and create a new connection to your new PostgreSQL instance

#. Download the database (see the :ref:`download-label` section) and unzip it
#. Open DBeaver, in the *Database Navigator* go to your connection (typically called "postgres" by default),
   and expand it down to Databases -> postgres
#. Right click on "postgres", go to Tools -> Restore
#. Inside the "input" section, in the "Backup file" box choose the .tar file you got from us
#. Click "Start"
