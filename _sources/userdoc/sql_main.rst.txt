Using the db
============

In order to use the database you need to have a
`PostgreSQL <https://www.postgresql.org/about/>`_ database instance running
somewhere in your computer (if you do it locally) or in the cloud (e.g., in
AWS, GC, etc.).

.. note ::
  We recommend you get a graphical tool to manage and develop your PostgreSQL
  databases. The PostgreSQL comes with PgAdmin, which is quite basic.
  We suggest you get a more advanced tool that can handle many database types,
  such as `DBeaver <https://dbeaver.io/>`_ or Pycharm.

#. If you don't have PostgreSQL running in your computer you need to install it
   first. You can download it `here <https://www.postgresql.org/download/>`_


#. Download the database (see the :ref:`download-label` section) and unzip it.
   The .tar file you unzipped contains the database you are about to install
#. Open DBeaver

  #. Create a new connection to your PostgreSQL instance:
     Database -> New Database Connection -> PostgreSQL
  #. In the *Database Navigator* go to your connection (typically
     called "postgres" by default), and expand it down to Databases -> postgres
  #. Right click on "postgres", go to Tools -> Restore
  #. Inside the "input" section, in the "Backup file" box choose the .tar file
     you got from us
  #. Click "Start"
