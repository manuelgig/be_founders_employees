####################################
The *be_founders-employees* database
####################################

This database contains rich micro-data about the employees (n=99,432) from a
sample of Belgian start-ups (m=910). It is a spin-off from the `be_founders project
<https://manuelgig.github.io/be_founders_documentation/>`_. Whereas
**be_founders** contains data about start-up founders only,
**be_founders_employees** contains information about the founders
*and* the employees.

Using the **be_founders** start-ups as a starting point, we developed bots
to find all their employees in a well-known employment-focused social media
platform, and to download publicly-available data about their employment and
education history. We developed NLP tools to pre-process, parse and disambiguate
the data, and the resulting database includes among other things:

* The individuals that were employed by the start-ups (up until 2022)
* Their work experience (employer, role, etc.)
* Their educational background (university/school, diploma, etc.)
* Basic demographic data

The data allows to approximate the personnel base of each start-up over time,
with rich information about turnover and churn, but employee skills, experience,
and networks.
